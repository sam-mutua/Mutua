# STA 2203 Labwork 

This section gives all the solutions to the lab work so far done in the period of lecture. 

## Labwork One

The first lab work was geared to enable the student to be able to plot a basic time series and be able to describe the data set. The packages used include `dplyr, lubridate, rKenyaForex, ggplot2`.

To install the above packages:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("dplyr","lubridate", "rKenyaForex", "ggplot2"))
```


We used in build data called `kenyaforex` to do a visualization of the exchange of Kenya Shilling versus US Dollar. 


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# loading the packages

library(rKenyaForex)

library(dplyr)

library(lubridate)

library(ggplot2)

# loading the data

Kenya <- kenyaforex %>% 
  filter(Currency == "US DOLLAR")

# Convert to time series

Kenya$Date <- ymd(Kenya$Date)

# ploting

ggplot(Kenya, aes(x = Date, y = Mean)) + geom_line(col = "blue") + theme_bw()
```

### Time Series Components

This section demonstrates how to do a visualization of the components of time series in R using the example of `AirPassengers` data inbuilt in R

#### Trend Component {-}

```{r}
# data 

Dec <- decompose(AirPassengers)

# trend component

Trend <- Dec$trend

# plot 

ts.plot(Trend, col = "red")
```


#### Seasonal Component {-}

```{r}
# data 

Dec <- decompose(AirPassengers)

# seasonal component

Seas <- Dec$seasonal

# plot 

ts.plot(Seas, col = "red")
```

#### Random Component {-}

```{r}
# data 

Dec <- decompose(AirPassengers)

# random component

RW <- Dec$random

# plot 

ts.plot(RW, col = "red")
```

### Simulating a Random Walk Process

A random walk process is given as:


$$Y_{t} = Y_{t-1} + e_{t}$$

The above process can be simulated as:


```{r}
# simulating the random walk 

RaW <- function(N, Y0, mean, sd)
{
  # define error terms
  
  e <- cumsum(rnorm(n = N, mean = 0, sd =sd))
  
  # process 
  
  Y <- Y0 + e
  
  # time 
  
  t <- 1:N
  
  Results <- data.frame(t, Y)
  
  return(Results)
}

# data 

Data <- RaW(100,10,0,1)

# plot

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Data, aes(x = t, y = Y)) + geom_line() + theme_bw() + labs(x = "Time", y = "Random Walk")
```


## Labwork Two

### Fitting a linear regression 

This example uses the data given in class.

```{r}
# reading in the data

t <- c(-4,-2,-1,0,1,2,5)

Xt <- c(67,88,94,85, 91, 98, 90)

# Model 

Model <- lm(Xt ~ t)

# Model output 

library(flextable)

as_flextable(Model)
```

Though the fitted model is not significant it is used for demonstration purposes only.

The trend values are extracted as follows

```{r}
t <- c(-4,-2,-1,0,1,2,5)

Xt <- c(67,88,94,85, 91, 98, 90)

Model <- lm(Xt ~ t)

# data

DataF <- data.frame(t, Xt)

DataF$Trend <- Model$fitted.values

knitr::kable(DataF)
```

### Fitting an Exponential Curve

We demonstrated how to fit an exponential curve to data.

```{r}
# data

Y <- c(25,25,27.9,31.9,36.1, 43.9,54.7)

t <- c(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3)

# Model

Model2 <- lm(log(Y) ~ t)

as_flextable(Model2)

# exponentiating the coefficients

exp(Model2$coefficients)
```


### Moving Average in R

During the lecture we did Moving Average as a method of eliminating trend.

```{r}
library(zoo)

t <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

Obs <- c(3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

# 3 point MA

KD <- data.frame(t, Obs)

KD$MA3 <- rollmean(Obs, k = 3, fill = NA)

# 4 point MA

KD$MA4 <- rollmean(Obs, k = 4, fill = NA)

knitr::kable(KD)
```
